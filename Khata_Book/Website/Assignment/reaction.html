    <h1>Chemical Reaction</h1>

    <h3>What is a Chemical Reaction?</h3>
    <p>A chemical reaction is in which the bonds are broken within reactant molecules, and new bonds are formed within
        product molecules in order to form a new substance. <br>
        Chemical reactions are all around us, from the metabolism of food in our body to how the light we get from the
        sun is the result of chemical reactions. Before beginning with chemical reactions, it is important to know about
        physical and chemical changes.</p>

    </ul>
    <h4> 1. Combustion Reaction</h4>
    <p>A combustion reaction is a reaction with a combustible material with an oxidizer to give an oxidized product. An
        oxidizer is a chemical a fuel requires to burn, generally oxygen. Consider the example of combustion of
        magnesium metal.
    </p>
    <h5>2Mg + O<sub>2</sub>&#8594; 2MgO + Heat</h5>
    <p>Here, 2 magnesium atoms react with a molecule of oxygen producing 2 molecules of the compound magnesium oxide
        releasing some heat in the process.</p>
    <h4>2. Decomposition Reaction</h4>
    <p>A Decomposition reaction is a reaction in which a single component breaks down into multiple products. Certain
        changes in energy in the environment have to be made like heat, light or electricity breaking bonds of the
        compound. Consider the example of the decomposition of calcium carbonate giving out CaO (Quick Lime) which is a
        major component of cement.</p>
    <h5>CaCO<sub>3</sub>(s) &#8594;(heat &#8593;) CaCO(s) + CO<sub>2</sub>(g)</h5>
    <img src="https://cdn1.byjus.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/03/Decomposition-Reaction.png" alt="">
    <p>Here, the compound Calcium carbonate when heated breaks down into Calcium Oxide and Carbon Dioxide.</p>
    <h4>3. Neutralization Reaction</h4>
    <p>A Neutralization reaction is basically the reaction between an acid and a base giving salt and water as the
        products. The water molecule formed is by the combination of OH– ions and H+ ions. The overall pH of the
        products when a strong acid and a strong base undergo a neutralization reaction will be 7. Consider the example
        of the neutralization reaction between Hydrochloric acid and Sodium Hydroxide giving out sodium chloride(Common
        Salt) and water.</p>
    <h5>HCl + NaOH &#8594; NaCl + H<sub>2</sub>O</h5>
    <p>Here, an acid and a base, Hydrochloric acid and Sodium Hydroxide react in a neutralization reaction to produce Sodium Chloride(Common Salt) and water as the products.</p>
    <h4>4. Redox Reaction</h4>
    <p>A REDuction-OXidation reaction is a reaction in which there is a transfer of electrons between chemical species. Let us consider the example of an electrochemical cell-like redox reaction between Zinc and Hydrogen.</p>
    <h5>Zn + 2H<sup>+</sup> &#8594; Zn<sup>2+</sup> + H<sub>2</sub></h5>
    <p>Here, A Zinc atom reacts with 2 ions of positively charged hydrogen to which electrons get transferred from the zinc atom and hydrogen becomes a stable molecule and Zinc ion is the product.</p>

    <h4>5. Precipitation or Double-Displacement Reaction</h4>
    <p>It is a type of displacement reaction in which two compounds react and consequently, their anions and cations switch places forming two new products. Consider the example of the reaction between silver nitrate and sodium chloride. The products will be silver chloride and sodium nitrate after the double-displacement reaction.</p>
    <h5>AgNO<sub>3</sub> + NaCl &#8594; AgCl + NaNO<sub>3</sub></h5>
    <img src="https://cdn1.byjus.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/03/Double-Displacement-Reaction.png" alt="">
    <p>Here, Silver Nitrate and Sodium Chloride undergo a double displacement reaction. Wherein Silver replaces Sodium in Sodium Chloride and Sodium joins with Nitrate becoming Sodium Nitrate along with the Silver Chloride as the product.</p>

    <h4>6. Synthesis Reaction</h4>
<p>A Synthesis reaction is one of the most basic types of reaction wherein multiple simple compounds combine under certain physical conditions giving out a complex product. The product will always be a compound. Let us consider the Synthesis reaction of sodium chloride with reactants solid sodium and chloride gas.</p>
<h5>2Na(s) + Cl<sub>2</sub>(g) &#8594; 2NaCl(s) </h5>
<p>Here, we have 2 Atoms of solid Sodium reacting with Chlorine gas giving out Sodium Chloride viz. Common Salt as the product.</p>

 <h4>What is an Exothermic Reaction?</h4>
<ul>
    <li><b>Definition:</b> An exothermic reaction is a chemical reaction that releases energy in the form of heat, light, or sound. The energy released is typically due to the formation of bonds in the products that are stronger than the bonds in the reactants.</li>
    <li><b>Energy Change:</b> The overall energy of the products is lower than that of the reactants, resulting in the release of excess energy to the surroundings.</li>
    <li><b>Example:</b><br>
        <ul>
            <li><b>Combustion : </b>CH<sub>4</sub> + 2O<sub>2</sub> → NaCl + H<sub>2</sub>O + energy (Burning of methane)</li>
            <li><b>Neutralization : </b>HCl + NaOH → NaCl + H<sub>2</sub>O + energy</li>
        </ul>

      </li>
    <li><b>Common Characteristics :</b>
        <ul>
            <li>Temperature of the surroundings increases.</li>
            <li>Often spontaneous.</li>
            <li><b>Example processes:</b> burning fuels, respiration, and rusting.</li>
        </ul>
    </li>
</ul>

<h4>What is an Endothermic Reactions ?</h4>
<ul>
    <li><b>Definition :</b> An endothermic reaction is a chemical reaction that absorbs energy from its surroundings, usually in the form of heat. The energy absorbed is required to break the bonds in the reactants, which is greater than the energy released when the products are formed.</li>
    <li><b>Energy Change :</b> The overall energy of the products is higher than that of the reactants, so energy is absorbed from the surroundings.</li>
    <li><b>Example:</b>
    <ul>
        <li><b>Photosynthesis : </b> 6CO<sub>2</sub> + 6H<sub>2</sub>O + energy → C<sub>6</sub>H<sub>12</sub>O<sub>6</sub> + 6O<sub>2</sub> </li>
        <li><b>Decomposition of Calcium Carbonate : </b>CaCO<sub>3</sub> + energy → CaO + CO<sub>2</sub></li>
    </ul>
    </li>
    <li><b>Common Characteristics :</b>
    <ul>
        <li>Temperature of the surroundings decreases.</li>
        <li>Often non-spontaneous, requiring continuous energy input.</li>
        <li><b>Example processes:</b> photosynthesis, cooking an egg, and dissolving ammonium nitrate in water.</li>
    </ul>
    </li>
</ul>
